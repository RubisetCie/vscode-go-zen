# Go for Visual Studio Code

The [VS Code Go extension] provides rich language support for the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/).

## Quick Start

To get started with Go Lang:

1.  Install [Go](https://go.dev) 1.18 or newer if you haven't already.

1.  Install the [VS Code Go extension].

1.  Open any directory or workspace containing Go code to automatically activate the extension. The [Go status bar](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/ui) appears in the bottom left corner of the window and displays your Go version.

1.  The extension depends on `go`, `gopls`, `dlv` and other optional tools. If any of the dependencies are missing, a warning will be displayed. Click on the warning to download dependencies.
